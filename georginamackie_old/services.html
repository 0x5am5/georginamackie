    	<h3>Outdoor Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>
          Georgina’s most challenging, motivating, and sociable form of exercise.
          Either join in with one of her existing groups or perhaps start your own. 
          If 4 or more friends/work colleagues have similar goals this could be an option for you.
          Why not set up your own private group. It’s such a fun way to get fit fast. <br />
          Each all over body session can burn up to 700cals!!!
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "I'm a member of a gym but I consider Georgies Boot Camp a vital part of my weekly workout routine. It feels amazing to get out into the open air after a day in the office and burn some calories. Georgie's incredibly passionate about excersice which makes her very motivating. She puts you though your paces so its hard (you see results very quickly) but the fact that she puts a great deal of thought into the structure of the sessions ensures that it never gets repetitive or boring.  Also, she's very entertaining and brilliant at making you feel like one big team.  Its tough but it works!  Above all its so much fun and that's what makes me go back every time" - Fran Finbow.

        <h3>1:1 Personal Training</h3>
        <p>
          For the personal touch why not have a  bespoke routine designed to achieve your own personal goals? Whether you’re training for a big event (marathon or specific sporting event) or just want to get fit and toned, Georgina can put together a programme to help you reach your goals.
        </p>

        <h3>Bridal Personal training</h3>
        <p>
          Being recently married Georgina has attracted many Bridal clients. She understands the importance of this event, which is why she has developed the ultimate wedding training packages that will achieve the best results! 
          Your tailored exercise plan will include postural work and nutrition information to have you glowing and looking amazing on the most important day of your life.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "As a typical bride to be, I was worried about bingo wings, back cleavage and having a burger belly on my wedding day. I wasn't getting the results at the gym and so I decided to try a personal trainer instead - it was the best decision I ever made!" - Stacey Dyzart.
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Sports Massage</h3>
        <p>
          Georgina is a fully qualified Sports Massage Therapist
        </p>
        <p>
          Sports massage therapy will help alleviate the stress and tension, which builds up in the body's soft tissues during physical activity.<br />
          Massage will help to drain away fatigue, to relieve swelling, to reduce muscle tension, to promote flexibility, to prevent injuries and, in the case of sports people, prepare for peak performance. Sports massage can help prevent those niggling injuries that so often get in the way of performance and achievement, whether a person is an athlete, a once a week jogger or just physically active. 
        </p>
  
        <h3>Nutritional advice</h3>
        <p>
          We are constantly being bombarded with fad diets and false promises. Every magazine you pick up promises to give you the body you've always dreamed of. The consequence of this conflicting advice can even result in weight gain rather than loss! <br />
          It&rsquo;s so confusing to know which way to turn if you're trying to lose weight, improve your shape and develop sustainable habits for healthy eating.<br />
          The truth is we're all totally different, with individual body types and strengths and weaknesses. There's no "one size fits all" approach or miracle diet when it comes to planning nutrition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Georgina will adapt your diet to suit <u>your</u> goals and lifestyle. She will create a bespoke nutrition plan and menu ideas so you don't get stuck for inspiration.<br />
          This service is offered to all her clients free of charge!!
