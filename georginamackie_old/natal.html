   	  <strong>Congratulations on your pregnancy!</strong>
   	  <p>
        As is the case with many health conditions, exercise can have a powerful and positive contribution to pregnancy when applied correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Georgina's personal training programme has been designed to ensure you stay fit and healthy throughout your pregnancy. She will minimize the effects of pregnancy on your posture, strengthen your stomach muscles and pelvic floor in preparation for the birth and finally, but by no means least, make it easier for you to get back into your pre-pregnancy jeans!

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "I have been training with Georgina from the start of my first pregnancy to maintain a healthy weight gain and physical strength for the birth. Georgina has a very clear understanding of the different stages of pregnancy and clearly informed me how my body was changing throughout the pregnancy, what the limitations were and how to work on particular parts of my developing pregnant body. This knowledge was fundamental to my developments giving me increased confidence throughout my pregnancy. There is really so much that one can read and I believe through working with a professional like Georgina, where sessions are tailored to your individual needs, do you really learn to listen to your body and help it go through enormous physical change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Georgina has a natural talent to motivate and ignite your inner will and self-discipline. (Not such an easy task when sometimes all you feel like doing is sleeping and eating!!)  I never envisaged I would feel so good during pregnancy, both physically and mentally and thats thanks to Georgina's teachings and training motivation.  Now at 39 weeks pregnant I feel physically strong and confident about my birth.  I look forward to our next chapter together with training after the birth!!
        </p>
        Thank you so much Georgina."

      <h3>Nutrition</h3> 
      <p>
        Gaining the right amount of weight during pregnancy by eating a healthy, balanced diet is a good sign that your baby is getting all the nutrients they need to develop at a healthy rate. It is not necessary to &quot;eat for two&quot; during pregnancy. It's true that you need extra calories from nutrient-rich foods to help your baby grow, but you generally need to consume only 300 more calories than you did before you became pregnant to meet the needs of your growing baby.
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowing what to eat and when can help ease morning sickness and other unpleasant side-effects of pregnancy.

      <h3>Buggy Bootcamps</h3>
      <p>
        Get back into shape after your baby – develop a wider social circle by meeting other mums in your area.<br>
        This all over body work out will have you toned and fit in no time.<br />
        Bringing your baby along removes any childcare issues. What better way to get back in shape than working outdoors with likeminded people and of course while bonding with your baby!
