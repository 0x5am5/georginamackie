          "I can't understand people slugging it out for hours in an overcrowded, expensive gym when you can be in the great outdoors breathing in fresh air?"
        </blockquote>
      <p>
        Research has proven that undertaking exercise outdoors provides a much greater feeling of wellbeing which can lead to rapid and sustainable results. Boost your energy levels, exercise enjoyment and engagement. It can also help prevent depression and tension!<br />
        Georgina is a qualified personal trainer (REPS Level 4). Her aim is to make exercise fun and enjoyable.
